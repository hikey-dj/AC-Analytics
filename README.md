## Permissions Explanation

For the **AC Analytics** Chrome extension, the following permissions are required, each serving a specific purpose to enhance user experience and functionality:

- `"storage"`: This permission is used to save user settings and bookmarks locally on the user's device. It allows for a personalized and consistent user experience across sessions by remembering user preferences and saved data.
- `"alarms"`: The alarms permission enables the extension to set reminders for daily problem-solving practice. This feature is designed to help users maintain a consistent practice schedule by allowing them to set and receive reminder notifications.
- `"notifications"`: This permission allows the extension to send notifications to the user. These notifications are reminders for scheduled problem-solving sessions.
- `"cookies"`: The cookies permission is used to access and manage cookies stored by the browser. It is being used to fetch the name of the current user.
- `"host_permissions"`: The extension requires permissions to interact with the AtCoder website (`"https://atcoder.jp/*"`). This permission is crucial for the extension to inject content scripts, modify web pages, and access data on the AtCoder site, enabling features like problem tracking, submission history analysis, and more.

Each permission is carefully considered and requested only when necessary to provide the features and functionality described. We are committed to respecting user privacy and minimizing the scope of permissions to what is strictly required for the extension's operation.
